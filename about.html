        <p><strong>JavaZone</strong> is an important meeting place for software developers in Scandinavia, and the biggest community driven conference of its kind. JavaZone has been described as a high quality, independent conference – a leading forum for knowledge exchange for IT-professionals.</p>

<p>Over 30 large and mid-sized companies – our partners – contribute with speakers and exhibit their brand and services/products during the conference. Without partners, volunteers, the speakers and the participants, the conference would not be possible.</p>

<p>Over the two conference days, we deliver more than 200,000 hours of expertise. In addition, many informal discussions take place at stands and between attendees. Altogether, JavaZone stands out as a tremendous arena for knowledge transfer.</p>

<p>A conference involving so many developers is also a key arena for recruitment. Through their exhibitions and other activities, our partners use the opportunity to promote their business and recruit new staff. JavaZone is more than just a conference. It’s a place to meet, network and socialize!</p>

<p>The Program Committee invites speakers from all over the world. Professionals know what professionals want, so the speakers are hand-picked, and the presentations are highly relevant. In the tradition of the conference, speakers are not paid an appearance fee for their contributions. Around half of the presentations are given in English and the other half in one of the Scandinavian languages. The conference’s unconventional and non-commercial approach has also boosted its popularity.</p>
