<h2>Call for Speakers is open</h2>
<p>To take place in Oslo, Norway, on September 12th-13th 2012, the conference will offer a combination of technical talks and panels in an informal atmosphere with an expected attendence of 2000. JavaZone 2012 will be the eleventh consecutive JavaZone conference. Join us in recreating the success from last years!</p>

<p>As previous years, last year's conference was a massive success, with software professionals and partners enjoying more than 100 sessions covering multiple topics, and an impressive lineup of internationally known speakers. Leading evangelists in the community rate JavaZone as one of the most important Java events in Europe. Both <a href="http://vimeo.com/javazone/videos" target="_blank">videos</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/jz11sessions" target="_blank">programs</a> from previous years are available.</p>

<p>The JavaZone conference is organized by javaBin, the Norwegian Java User Group (JUG). JavaBin is an idealistic, non-profit organization established in 1996 by a group of Java enthusiasts. The JUG has since evolved to be the leading group for promotion of the Java platform in Scandinavia.</p>

<h3>Topics</h3>
Abstracts should be tagged with the appropriate topics from the list below:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Alternative Languages</strong> - Programming paradigms, concepts, and languages...</li>
    <li><strong>Architecture in Practice</strong> - Architectures of amazing applications, architecture refactoring, accidental/evolutionary architecture, why it suceeded / why it failed?</li>
    <li><strong>Big Data and NoSQL</strong> - Cassandra, Hadoop, MongoDB, HBase, CouchDB, DynamoDB, Neo4j, ...</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous Delivery</strong> - Automated build & deployment, DevOps, virtualization, monitoring, infrastructure ...</li>
    <li><strong>Core Java</strong> - AOP, concurrency, generics, Java memory model, bytecode, ...</li>
    <li><strong>Distributed Systems and Cloud</strong> - High performance / scalability / availability, concurrency in cloud applications, integration technology, ...</li>
    <li><strong>Enterprise</strong> - Big projects, big systems, integration, simpler enterprise software development, coping with complexity ...</li>
    <li><strong>Experience Report</strong> - Going from Maven to Gradle, How we failed when replacing SQL with NoSQL, ...</li>
    <li><strong>Frontend</strong> - Rich user experience, AJAX, thick clients / Swing, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, ClojureScript, HTML5, CSS, Sass
    <li><strong>Innovation and Startups</strong> - Creativity and follow-through, Profiting off ideas, Lean Startups, Funding and organisation, ...</li>

    <li><strong>Software Craftsmanship and Tools</strong> - Testing, programming practices, refactoring, tools, TDD / BDD, ...</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a sufficiently awesome talk that falls outside these areas but fits the idea of the conference, please submit that too. The audience consists mostly of software developers and generally talks should be technical enough that they include code (although that is not a requirement). Talks purely related to practices (agile etc.) are less likely to be accepted.</p>

<h3>Communities</h3>
<p>This year we would like also to invite the Communities to submit suggestions for talks, and we will provide dedicated slots for topics not normally associated with earlier JavaZone conferences.</p>

<h3>Format and duration</h3>
<p>The presentations may be given in two formats, either a 60 minute presentation or a 10 minute lightning talk.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Speakers of accepted <strong>presentations</strong> will get free admission to the conference. They will also be invited to the speakers dinner and can join us on the JourneyZone.</li>
  <li>Speakers of accepted <strong>lightning talks</strong> will be invited to the speakers dinner and can join us on the JourneyZone but have to provide for their own admission to JavaZone. Lightning talk speakers will be able to buy tickets at early bird price no matter when the ticket is bought.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Levels</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Introductory</strong> - a basic introduction to a subject. Assume no knowledge of the subject.</li>
  <li><strong>Intermediate</strong> - expecting more than basic knowledge of a subject, but not yet advanced.</li>
  <li><strong>Advanced</strong> - Good knowledge of the subject.</li>
  <li><strong>Hardcore</strong> - Assume a fair amount of knowledge in the audience. Do not spend more than 5-7 minutes on setting the stage or introducing your topic.</li>
</ul>
<p>
To mark the talk as "Hardcore", please follow these guidelines:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Must be technical in nature</li>
    <li>Must avoid unnecessary introductory material.</li>
    <li>Should not spend more than 5 minutes on the introduction/setting.</li>
    <li>Should ideally focus on a single subject, for instance "classloaders", "debugging", "bytecode generation", "the monoid".
    <li>Should be between 45 to 55 minutes (or a hardcore 10 minute lightning talk if its feasible)
    Remember: The deeper and more hardcore, the better.</li>
</ul>

The Journey will be a great base for trips at all skill levels.</p>

<p>More information about the trips destination, departure and arrival times to Oslo will be provided.</p>

<p>Practical information summarized:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Transport, food, guides and accommodation are arranged and provided.</li>
  <li>The Journey will be adjusted for all hiking skill levels.</li>
  <li>Your personal expenses are estimated to NOK 1500.</li>
</ul>

<p>More detailed information will be provided closer to the conference. For questions and registration get in touch with us at program@java.no.</p>

<h3>Monitary policy</h3>
<p>The organiser of JavaZone is javaBin (the Norwegian Java User Group), an independent, non-profit organization. The conference has partners but no sponsors. The agenda is defined by the Program Committee without external interference. This independence is among the things that make JavaZone unique. We therefore have a limited budget for reimbursing conference speakers. Please see our <a href="http://jz10.java.no/moneypolicy.html" target="_blank">monitary policy</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Contact information</h3>
<p>Please do not hesitate to contact us at program@java.no should you need any further information.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there, and feel free to spread the word about JavaZone 2012 in your local community.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
The JavaZone Program Committee</p>
